# Forecasting-on-the-Penguin-arrival-in-Auckland

# Abstract

The purpose of this project to analyse the penguin arrival in Auckland, New Zealand, and forecast the arrival for the next two years. To find the existence of seasonality trend/ pattern if any and to predict their future pattern/ trend according to the analysis conducted on the data. Even though the future is unobservable, by observing the past pattern of the data help us to predict future values. Model Specification is carried out based on the orders in the ACF, PACF, EACF plots. Model Selection is done with the model with lowest AIC score. Followed by the residual analysis is performed to check the fitness of the model. So that the best fit model is chosen and can be used to forecast future values for the next 2 years.

# Introduction

Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless marine birds. Their charm and cuteness make them dear to all and hence they attract a lot of visitors. They live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere. Only one species found north of the equator.

Especially Hoiho breed (Yellow-Eyed Penguin) is one of the rare species which found only in New Zealand, are the main attraction for tourist as it gives the rare opportunity to observe penguins in their natural habitat. Hence, to improve the tourism of New Zealand, need analysis on the following topics: What is the best time to visit? Does the breathtaking beauty of penguin parade depend on seasonality? Does the number of penguins vary yearly? Letâ€™s discuss these things based on the number of penguins arrived monthly in Auckland from 2000 to 2006.
